**Describe the Bug**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. A simple "Counters+ doesn't work" aint gonna cut it, chief!

**Attach or Link Files**
To help me solve this issue, I might need access to more then what you say or provide.

A helpful start will be to attach your current Counters+ Config (Located in `Beat Saber/UserData/CountersPlus.ini`) to this report.

If you wish to be even more helpful, try taking a screenshot of the Beat Saber Console when you reproduce the issue (`--verbose` in the start arguments. You can use Google to figure out how to take a screenshot.)

If you want to be my best friend, attach the latest log with a date and time name (**Not** `latest.log.gz`), located in `Beat Saber/Logs/Counters+`.

**Probable Culprit**
Use that big brain of yours to come up with a probable culprit for your issue. Is it Score Counter? Maybe outdated dependencies? Or maybe you just haven't updated your mods in a really long time *(Which you probably should.)*

**Screenshots or Video**
If applicable, add screenshots or videos to help me out. Sometimes, words ain't enough!

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

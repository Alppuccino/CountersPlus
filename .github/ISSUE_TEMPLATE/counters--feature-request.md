**Is it because of an issue?**
If it is, tell me what's up!

**Describe your solution**
Give me what you want. Short descriptions, long novels, don't matter to me. However, the more ideas I get in my head, the better!

**A programmer yourself?**
If you have experience in programming (Preferably C#), and either have or have not gotten into Beat Saber modding, feel free to fork Counters+, and try to implement this idea for yourself. I'm always open to pull requests!

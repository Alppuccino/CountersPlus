# CountersPlus
A combination of widely-used counters, all configurable in one mod.

## What is this?
**Counters+** (Also known as CountersPlus) is a mod that combines counters, both new and widely used, into one mod. Counters+ also supports a large amount of customization, going from positions and ordering, to even using the counters available in game!

## Available Counters
***Progress*** (Since `1.0.0`) | Overwrites the in-game counter with the original we all know and love!

***Score*** (Since `1.0.0`) | Also overwrites with the original Score counter!

***Missed*** (Since `1.0.0`) | Counts missed notes in a song.

***Notes*** (Since `1.0.0`, previously *Accuracy*) | Notes hit over notes in total. Now in percentages!

***Speed*** (Since `1.1.0`, suggested by Ragesaq) | *"Speed, motherfucker, do you speak it?"* Displays how fast your arms are swinging!

***Cut*** (Since `1.1.0`) | Displays the average cut score (Anywhere from 0-110), so you can see how well you are hitting those notes!

## Configuration

### Plugin-wide settings
***Enabled*** | Toggles the plugin on and off, and hides all other submenus if disabled!

***RNG*** | Adds some RNG flair to your counters. Change different settings over time!

***Disable Menus*** | Hides other submenus while keeping Counters+ enabled.

### Every Counter has these 3 options
***Enabled*** | Toggles the counter on or off.

***Position*** | Sets the position relative to commonly used UI elements (Above/Below Counter, Above/Below Multiplier, Above the Highway, or Below Energy.)

***Index*** | Otherwise known as the order. A higher Index would set the Counter farther away from the position.

### Advanced Options
***Decimal Precision*** (*Notes*, *Score*, and *Speed*) | How precise do the decimals go?

***Override Base Game Counter*** (*Progress*, *Score*) | Whether or not to use the base game counter instead of replacing it with our own. **Some features will not be reflected when using the base game counters!**

***Show Precentage*** (*Notes*) | Shows the precentage

***Display Rank*** (*Score*) | Displays the Rank you get during a song (SS, S, A, B, C, D, E)

***Progress Time Left*** (*Progress*) | The counter starts at full, and decreases as you progress though a song.

***Mode*** (*Speed*) | Changes the display mode for the Counter (See Hint Text in-game for more detail)
